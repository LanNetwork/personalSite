This post is going to chronicle how I am switching from a disorganized note taking method which consists of Trello, Google Keep, and random paper notes - to a unified note taking method. From now on, all of my information storage needs will be filled by the application Obsidian. I already made a few small notes, but mostly to test out the markdown formatting and graph function.

Then I got the idea to make a map of all the people I know. I been keeping little notes on people for a while, mostly to remember names if I was meeting a bunch of people at once. I did this using Google Drive. I liked the idea of a searchable database of names and information about all the people I know. I have filled out a couple of people like my brother, my mom, and a couple others.

I like the idea of having a more comprehensive note system for many things in my life.

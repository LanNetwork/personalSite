      <description>This post is going to chronicle how I am switching from a disorganized note taking method which consists of Trello, Google Keep, and random paper notes - to a unified note taking method. From now on, all of my information storage needs will be filled by the application Obsidian. I already made a few small notes, but mostly to test out the markdown formatting and graph function. Then I got the idea to make a map of all the people I know.</description>

      <description>Here is a picture of me: And this is my website!
In this first post, I will discuss how I generated this website using hugo to create this website, and some of the challenges I faced. I am not primarily a web developer, so it was a bit confusing to work with HTML and shortcodes and such.
For now however, I am too tired. I am going to bed, and working on this tomorrow.</description>
